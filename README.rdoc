My attempt at solving the problems of Project Euler in ruby.

=== Generator
There's a simple generator that creates a default script that'll output a warning if the solution runs longer than 60 seconds.

==== Example
To generate the script for problem 1
  ruby gen.rb 1
This will create the file 1.rb using the template.
